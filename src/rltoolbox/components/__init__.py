"""
RLtoolbox components package.

This package contains built-in components for the RLtoolbox framework.
Components are the building blocks that implement specific functionality
such as environments, agents, algorithms, loggers, etc.

Note: This package is currently empty as the built-in components
are not yet implemented. Users should create their own components
by inheriting from RLComponent or use external component packages.
"""

# This package is currently empty but provides a namespace
# for future built-in components like:
# - SimpleEnvironment
# - EpsilonGreedyAgent
# - ReplayBufferAgent
# - ConsoleLogger
# - FileLogger
# - CSVLogger
# - MetricsLogger
# etc.
